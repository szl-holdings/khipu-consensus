# khipu-consensus

### Turns a chain of AI governance checks into a tamper-evident group decision — at least 3 of 4 independent witnesses must cryptographically agree before any action is allowed. Safety/liveness are Conjecture 2 / Conjecture 3 (proof-deferred, NOT proven).

## 💡 Why it matters

It removes the single point of failure in AI governance: no one component (and no one compromised key) can wave an action through. Every approved action carries independently verifiable signatures, so auditors can prove after the fact exactly who agreed and why.

## 🔍 How it works

In two sentences: this component is part of SZL's governed-AI mesh — it enforces policy and emits signed, replayable audit receipts so every AI action can be verified after the fact. The full mathematical foundation, formal proofs, and protocol details are documented below and in the [technical docs](https://szl-holdings.github.io/docs-site).

# Khipu Consensus — BFT 3-of-4 multi-party signed agreement

> The category SZL invents: **multi-party-witnessed AI.** Turn a chain of
> governance "organs" into a **Byzantine-fault-tolerant multi-signature
> agreement**. Each witness signs an action hash with its **own** ECDSA-P256 key.
> **≥ 3 valid `allow` signatures over the same action ⇒ canonical.** 2-of-4 or
> fewer ⇒ **rejected**.

This is the open-source reference for the consensus protocol that powers SZL
Holdings' Khipu receipts. It is named for the Inka *khipu* (knotted-cord record),
used here purely as a **brand**; the protocol itself is standard DSSE + cosign +
BFT quorum counting.

## The idea in one paragraph

A single AI action (e.g. "select this effector", "approve this transaction") is
hashed to a 32-byte `action_hash`. The hash is sent **in parallel** to `n`
independent witnesses. Each witness runs its own governance check and returns a
**DSSE-signed verdict** (`allow` or `block`) signed with its **own keyid**
(`<witness>-cosign`). A verifier counts how many signatures (a) cryptographically
verify against that witness's published public key, (b) carry an `allow` verdict,
and (c) are over the **exact** `action_hash`. If the count reaches the
`threshold`, the action is **canonical**; otherwise it is **rejected**. With
`n = 4, threshold = 3` the protocol tolerates exactly one faulty / Byzantine /
unavailable witness (the classic `n ≥ 3f + 1` bound for a witness quorum).

```
            ┌──────────┐   sign(action_hash, gate-cosign)   
   action ─▶│ Witness1 │───────────────────────────────┐
      │     └──────────┘                                │
      │     ┌──────────┐   sign(action_hash, memory-cosign) 
      ├────▶│ Witness2 │───────────────────────────────┤
      │     └──────────┘                                ▼
      │     ┌──────────┐   sign(action_hash, a11oy-cosign)   ┌───────────────┐
      ├────▶│  a11oy   │──────────────────────────────────▶ │  tally(≥3/4)? │
      │     └──────────┘                                     └───────┬───────┘
      │     ┌──────────┐   sign(action_hash, killinchu-cosign)       │
      └────▶│Killinchu │───────────────────────────────────────────▶│
            └──────────┘                              canonical ◀────┘────▶ rejected
```

## Why every signature is real

Each per-witness signature is **ECDSA-P256-SHA256 over the DSSE Pre-Authentication
Encoding (PAE)** of the canonical-JSON verdict statement. It is therefore
verifiable by the [Sigstore Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign) CLI:

```bash
cosign verify-blob --key gate-cosign.pub --signature sig.b64 --insecure-ignore-tlog pae.bin
# Verified OK
```

…and by plain OpenSSL (`openssl dgst -sha256 -verify gate-cosign.pub -signature sig.bin pae.bin`).

## Implementations

| Language   | Path          | Verify | Sign | Tests |
|------------|---------------|:------:|:----:|:-----:|
| Python     | `python/`     | ✓      | ✓    | `python/tests` |
| TypeScript | `typescript/` | ✓      | ✓    | `typescript/test` |
| Go         | `go/`         | ✓      | —    | `go/consensus_test.go` |

All three verify the **same** deterministic vectors in [`testdata/vectors.json`](testdata/vectors.json).

### Quick start (Python)

```python
import json
from khipu_consensus import tally
v = json.load(open("testdata/vectors.json"))
r = tally(v["action_hash"], v["cases"][0]["signatures"], v["pubkeys"], threshold=3, n=4)
print(r.khipu_consensus, r.decision)   # 4-of-4 canonical
```

## DSSE PAE (the exact bytes signed)

```
PAE(type, body) = "DSSEv1" SP LEN(type) SP type SP LEN(body) SP body
SIGNATURE       = ECDSA_P256_SHA256( PAE("application/vnd.szl.khipu.organ-verdict+json", canonical_json(statement)) )
```

`canonical_json` = JSON with sorted keys, compact separators (`,`/`:`), UTF-8.

## Formal model

The safety and liveness properties are formalised in Lean 4 (see
[`docs/FORMAL.md`](docs/FORMAL.md)) as **Conjecture 2** (`khipu_consensus_safety`)
and **Conjecture 3** (`khipu_consensus_liveness`). They are **proof-deferred**
(tracked, not theorems) — siblings of SZL's Λ Conjecture. The decidable counting
predicates and the canonicity decision are fully proved.

## Honesty

- Witness **public** keys live in `testdata/vectors.json` (and `testdata/*.test.pub`) and are **TEST-ONLY**.
  Matching **private** keys are deliberately **not committed** (doctrine: never commit a private key); see
  [`testdata/REGEN.md`](testdata/REGEN.md) to regenerate throwaway keys locally — the vector suite is verify-only and needs no private key.
- This repo is the **protocol**, not the witnesses. Production witnesses run their
  own governance brains and publish their own per-witness public keys.
- Sigstore Rekor transparency-log anchoring is supported via DSSE bundles; the
  level of multi-sig support depends on your Rekor version (≥ v0.10 for DSSE
  bundles). See [`docs/REKOR.md`](docs/REKOR.md).
